In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the """"Jazz Age,"""" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance.

Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.
~~~
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 
1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes
2. Explain how Peer Instruction can be used to address identified challenges with student engagement 
3. Reflect on the relationship between technology and pedagogy in the service of student learning 
4. Think differently and holistically about what makes good teaching and learning

37305,Perspectives on university teaching for neurodiverse learners,GPTK,702,"The number of students who present with specific learning difficulties and developmental learning disorders at universities in Quebec is on the rise. Many of these students, including those presenting with dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and dyspraxia, can be grouped under the modern umbrella term Neurodiversity.

This 2-hour workshop aims to provide attendees with a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying different sensory processing of learning materials by students belonging to the groups mentioned above. Specifically, participants will gain insight into the perceptual processing of written materials and visuals by individuals with dyslexia. Further, this workshop will address why certain practical methods can be of great help to neurodiverse learners, and how these can be integrated with Concordia?s ?feedforward? learning and teaching approach.

~~~
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
?	understand the neurodiversity framework and the brain mechanisms underlying the disorders it includes
?	understand the neural processes leading neurodiverse students with learning disorders and different needs to learn differently

49462,From Scholarly Research to Crafting an Op-Ed,GPLL,12,"Although academic journals and other scholarly outlets are valuable, their impact outside of academia is questionable as scholarly publications often sit in digital repositories where they are rarely read by non-academics.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed.

The possibilities vulnerability brings are endless. Sounds like a no-brainer? What if we told you there is a simple way to make all of this happen? The only thing to do to grasp the power of vulnerability is to sign up to Melissa Dawn?s online workshop.

49812,Deciphering Legal and Ethical Aspects of AI (Online),CEPS,1124EO,"*VID*
*KEYB*

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives.

49901,Peer-review: CGS Master?s applications (all discplines),GPLL,439,"Peer-review is the cornerstone of academic assessment and provides a useful exercise to improve projects, proposals, and papers. In this workshop, we strive to improve scholarship applications for potential and current Master?s students at Concordia University ? applying for the Canada Graduate Scholarship Master?s program. 

Participants in this workshop will be expected to provide 2-3 pages of text from their draft applications to drive the peer-review process (submitted ~1 week prior to the meeting), and will subsequently have 5-6 days to provide feedback on the text from 2-3 other students (written feedback ~24h before the class, and verbal feedback within the actual workshop). This exercise can be done for virtually any section of the scholarship application but will likely be most useful for research proposals or other ?contribution? statements. The Canada Graduate Scholarship application process is harmonized across the Tri-Agency, so applications can include research proposals in the natural sciences and engineering (NSERC), health (CIHR), or the social sciences and humanities (SSHRC).

Components of your ePortfolio will be due incrementally so that, by the end of course, you will have a version of an ePortfolio that you can share with potential collaborators and/or employers. No previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that encapsulates your work as a graduate student and early career professional. Think of it as an expanded CV. Whereas a CV ?tells? the reader of your achievements, the ePortfolio ?shows? the reader what you?ve done in detail. ePortfolio?s are increasingly requested in job applications since they summarize your skills and accomplishments in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. It is an opportunity to show your professional identity and maybe even be discovered! 

The ePortfolio for this course will contain the following pages: 
1.	About: a brief biographical statement
2.	Contact: a way to encourage correspondence 
3.	Projects: publications, multimedia/audiovisual works, media appearances, etc. 
4.	Optional pages for your education, research interests, extracurricular activities, etc.

This hybrid course spans 4 weeks with four 1-hour synchronous lectures over Zoom on Friday mornings. Between the weekly lectures, participants MUST consult recommended videos available through the Udemy workshop, ?Wordpress for Beginners - Master Wordpress Quickly? taught by Andrew Williams. These videos will cover essential information that will not be covered in the lectures but is key to building your ePortfolio. A Moodle site will also exist.

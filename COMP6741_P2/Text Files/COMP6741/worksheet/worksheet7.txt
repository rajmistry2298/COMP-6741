COMP474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2021)
Worksheet #7: Intelligent Agents
Task 1. What kind of question would you expect a Concordia Chatbot to be able to handle?
1. For new students (not currently registered at Concordia):
•
2. For current students (already enrolled at Concordia):
Task 2. Write a regular expression that matches different variations of naming https://www.wikidata.org/
wiki/Q326342: “Concordia”, “Concordia U.”, “CU”, “Concordia University”, “Université Concordia”, . . . :

Task 3. Suppose we want to use an existing set of 1000 questions for training a ML classifier. If we use tf-idf
vectors to represent each question, how many dimensions will the vectors have (make a rough estimate)?
Task 4. Ok, here is an (extremely simplified) idea of creating 2D feature vectors out of a natural language
question: The first dimension a encodes the first occurrence of a question word (see table below) and the
second dimension b the number of Capital Letters in the sentence:
Contains? Value
Who 1
What 2
Where 3
(none) 0
# Question a b Class
1 Where is Concordia? Location
2 Who was Steve Jobs? Definition
3 What city is McGill in? Location
4 What is NLP? Definition
Task 5. Using the online parser at https://corenlp.run/, create a parse tree for the sentence What is McGill?.Ï
Note that you can now extract the subject of the sentence, e.g., to plug it into a SPARQL query.
Task 6. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new question below to classify its type. Use
k = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =
√∑n
i=1(pi − qi)2:
# Question a b d-Q1 d-Q2 d-Q3 d-Q4 Class?
5 What is McGill?
You can now match the new question with a corresponding SPARQL template to obtain a query for your
knowledge graph, filling in variables with the values extracted from the question.
Task 7. For the questions in Task 1 above, which of the chatbot techniques covered so far would be able to
answer them?
1.
2.

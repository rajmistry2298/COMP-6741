The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative.

*KEYB*
Let's face it, some people are intimidated by museums and galleries. They don't know how to approach a work of art, how to interpret it. They might even be afraid to say something that sounds silly, or worse, stupid. Thankfully, there are people in the museum to help them develop their ability to better understand and appreciate art. And you might be one of them. But first, you'll need to complete this course. All of the guides at the MMFA have and we're confident you will, too. This course will challenge your vision of the traditional role of a guide in an art museum and give you the tools to offer visitors meaningful learning experiences. If you want to help bring art to life, this course is a masterpiece.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
?	Understand the contexts in which the work of an MMFA guide occurs;
?	Reflect critically on the role and practice of a guide;
?	Identify multiple ways for interpreting works of art;
?	Research artists and objects in the MMFA collection using in-house and online resources;
?	Create a scenario as the basis for encounters with groups of visitors;
?	Facilitate group art interpretation that encourages observation, reflection, meaning-making, and dialogue; 
?	Contribute to ongoing collective learning amongst fellow guide recruits through mutual support, shared responsibility and active participation.
*APP*
This is a blend of theory and active learning through  demonstrations, ongoing feedback, workshops, guest speakers, both in the classroom and in the galleries. Active, enthusiastic participation is one of the keys to success in this course.
*WHO*
?	Anyone who wants to help bring art to life in the MMFA.
?	Anyone who wants to become a volunteer guide at the MMFA.

The possibilities vulnerability brings are endless. Sounds like a no-brainer? What if we told you there is a simple way to make all of this happen? The only thing to do to grasp the power of vulnerability is to sign up to Melissa Dawn?s online workshop.

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives.

Components of your ePortfolio will be due incrementally so that, by the end of course, you will have a version of an ePortfolio that you can share with potential collaborators and/or employers. No previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that encapsulates your work as a graduate student and early career professional. Think of it as an expanded CV. Whereas a CV ?tells? the reader of your achievements, the ePortfolio ?shows? the reader what you?ve done in detail. ePortfolio?s are increasingly requested in job applications since they summarize your skills and accomplishments in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. It is an opportunity to show your professional identity and maybe even be discovered! 

The ePortfolio for this course will contain the following pages: 
1.	About: a brief biographical statement
2.	Contact: a way to encourage correspondence 
3.	Projects: publications, multimedia/audiovisual works, media appearances, etc. 
4.	Optional pages for your education, research interests, extracurricular activities, etc.

This hybrid course spans 4 weeks with four 1-hour synchronous lectures over Zoom on Friday mornings. Between the weekly lectures, participants MUST consult recommended videos available through the Udemy workshop, ?Wordpress for Beginners - Master Wordpress Quickly? taught by Andrew Williams. These videos will cover essential information that will not be covered in the lectures but is key to building your ePortfolio. A Moodle site will also exist.

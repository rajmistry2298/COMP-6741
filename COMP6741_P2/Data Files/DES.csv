8852,"""The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the """"Jazz Age,"""" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance.

22617,"This course is a multidisciplinary introduction to the field of Irish studies, a discipline that embraces a broad range of historical and contemporary issues as they have manifested themselves on the island of Ireland, in Canada and throughout the world. In particular, questions related to individual and national identities in the context of history, language, culture, landscape, and religion are explored and debated."
22618,"Drawing on a diversity of historiographical materials, this interdisciplinary course examines the story of the Irish in Canada with a particular emphasis on Quebec, from the French colonial period through the City of Montreal's golden era of mercantile prominence in the mid-19th century to the break-up of its older Irish neighbourhoods a century afterwards. Starting with the demographics of Irish immigration and settlement, it devotes special attention to social and cultural relations between the Irish and other ethnic groups.

"
22619,"From 17th-century fishermen and traders arriving in Newfoundland to displaced victims of the Famine in the 19th century, to contemporary immigrants from Ireland, the Irish have had a presence in all parts of Canada from the earliest days of settlement. This course examines the emigration and settlement patterns of Irish immigrants in the various regions of Canada across a period of three centuries, paying particular attention to their role in the social, economic, political, cultural, and educational development of Canadian society. The course explores the various strategies by which Irish immigrants both adapted to and transformed the particular host society in which they found themselves, and looks at other immigrant communities as a means of understanding the special contribution of the Irish to Canada.

22631,"Irish Studies span a spectrum of disciplines from the humanities, fine arts and the social and political sciences. Conducting research within this diverse domain requires a broad-based set of applied and theoretical skills. This interdisciplinary course prepares upper-level undergraduates for research in Irish studies, for academic and field situations in Ireland, and in Irish diasporic settings overseas. While cross-disciplinary methodologies are emphasized throughout the course, particular attention is given to research planning and logistics, archival investigation, cross-cultural interviewing, ?participant observation? fieldwork training, applied theoretical modelling, and thesis management."

22633,"This course examines the social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions of the Great Irish Famine. Beginning with a thorough examination of society and politics in the pre-Famine period, the course explores the causes and course of the 1845-50 Famine, with emphasis on social conditions, mass mortality, emigration, and British government responses to conditions in Ireland. The outcomes and long-term consequences of the Famine for Irish society, politics, Anglo-Irish relations, and the Irish Diaspora are also explored. Some attention is also given to historiographical debates and Famine memory.

22634,"After surveying the historical roots of the divisions in Northern Irish society, the course traces the successive phases of the prolonged ?Troubles? (1968 to 1998): the Catholic civil rights movement; the period of armed conflict between the IRA, loyalist paramilitaries, and security forces; and the recent peace process, as well as post-conflict issues including power-sharing, peace and reconciliation, and constitutional change. Attention is also given to cultural expressions of the Troubles and its legacies.

NOTE: Students who have received credit for this topic under a HIST or IRST 398 number may not take this course for credit."
22635,"This course explores the political, military, social, and cultural dimensions of the turbulent period in Irish history that dissolved over a century of Anglo-Irish Union and established two new states. The course necessarily focuses on Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army's efforts to achieve independence from Britain, but considerable attention is also given to Ulster Unionist resistance to separatism. Additionally, other forces and dynamics that shaped this seminal period are explored, such as sectarian violence in Northern Ireland; conflict between rival nationalist factions in the south; labour and socialist agitations; agrarian discontents; and the women's suffrage and feminist movements.

NOTE: Students who have received credit for this topic under a HIST 398 number may not take this course for credit."
22636,"Under pressure for over 200 years from the expanding use of English, Irish is still considered by many a crucial underpinning of Irish national identity. This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-nós songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape (dinnsheanchas: the Irish lore of place names) and how it both actively and subliminally remains a potent force in Irish cultural life.

NOTE: Students who have received credit for this topic under an IRST 399 number may not take this course for credit."
22637,"This course traces a colourful history from the mid-19th century to the present, exploring, amongst other works, the melodramas of Dionysius Boucicault; the pithy plays of Oscar Wilde; the arguably propagandistic work of WB Yeats and Augusta Gregory; the existentialism of Samuel Beckett; the Hiberno-Greek tragedies of Marina Carr; and the Tarantino inspired comedies of Martin McDonagh. Illuminating the politics ? national, postcolonial, gendered and global ? present in Irish theatre, this course shows that when theatre holds a mirror up to the Irish nation, a wider world is reflected back.

37304,"Peer instruction is a research-based pedagogy that actively engages students in the classroom and has been shown to dramatically improve conceptual understanding, even in large classes. The basic goals of peer instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.
~~~
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 
1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes

Let's face it, some people are intimidated by museums and galleries. They don't know how to approach a work of art, how to interpret it. They might even be afraid to say something that sounds silly, or worse, stupid. Thankfully, there are people in the museum to help them develop their ability to better understand and appreciate art. And you might be one of them. But first, you'll need to complete this course. All of the guides at the MMFA have and we're confident you will, too. This course will challenge your vision of the traditional role of a guide in an art museum and give you the tools to offer visitors meaningful learning experiences. If you want to help bring art to life, this course is a masterpiece.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
?	Understand the contexts in which the work of an MMFA guide occurs;
?	Reflect critically on the role and practice of a guide;
?	Identify multiple ways for interpreting works of art;
?	Research artists and objects in the MMFA collection using in-house and online resources;

This diversity is expressed in terms of the students? ages, cultural background, language, disability condition, socio-economic status, and other non-traditional profiles. The heterogeneity of this inclusive classroom and our new online reality brings with it the challenge to design courses that meet the objectives of the course or program while effectively responding to the needs of all learners. In order to meet these challenges, innovative approaches like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) are being implemented. Designing our courses using these strategies and techniques makes them more accessible to everyone, thus reducing the need for individual accommodations.

48521,"This lecture course introduces students to digital games, their history and their relationship to contemporary art practices. Digital games are considered as a medium of play, social interaction and artistic expression. The course situates digital games in an (art) historical context in order to better understand concepts of play in a digital age and the relevance of games to current art practices, beginning with examples of earlier games and their role as material culture. Students then reconsider the roles played by the art, the artist and the player/gamer as they are situated at the intersection between art, play and technology. Class discussions address life in virtual spaces and the relationships of power, capital, gender, ethnicity and other identities to both games and contemporary digital media.

49462,"Although academic journals and other scholarly outlets are valuable, their impact outside of academia is questionable as scholarly publications often sit in digital repositories where they are rarely read by non-academics.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ?lede? and ?hook? (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field.

There are many misconceptions out there about vulnerability and its place in work environments. The truth is, it takes real strength to be vulnerable, but the payoff is huge.

Vulnerability can potentially allow dealing with difficult conversations, owning mistakes and learning from them, embracing unique strengths and talents, never worrying about what others might think or say? The possibilities vulnerability brings are endless. Sounds like a no-brainer? What if we told you there is a simple way to make all of this happen? The only thing to do to grasp the power of vulnerability is to sign up to Melissa Dawn?s online workshop.

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives.

In it, we will focus on the major federal and provincial agencies providing scholarships in research sectors related to natural sciences/engineering (NSERC, FRQNT), and health (CIHR, FRQS). A brief overview of most essential components will be provided, but strong emphasis will be given to writing tips for key sections of the application (e.g. outline of proposed research, most significant contributions).

Note: Students are still ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they ultimately select.

After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
1.	Identify appropriate funding opportunities, collect and develop all parts of the application, understand the scoring and competitive process underlying these programs.
2.	Draft major sections of the application: An outline of proposed research, as well as a research contributions or most significant contributions statement.
3.	Seek out appropriate reviewers for each section that will be able to help improve the application.

This project-based course will be taught over 4 weeks using multiple channels, including video tutorials on Udemy (6.5 hours), Zoom lectures (4 hours), and weekly assignments. Components of your ePortfolio will be due incrementally so that, by the end of course, you will have a version of an ePortfolio that you can share with potential collaborators and/or employers. No previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that encapsulates your work as a graduate student and early career professional. Think of it as an expanded CV. Whereas a CV ?tells? the reader of your achievements, the ePortfolio ?shows? the reader what you?ve done in detail. ePortfolio?s are increasingly requested in job applications since they summarize your skills and accomplishments in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. It is an opportunity to show your professional identity and maybe even be discovered! 

The ePortfolio for this course will contain the following pages: 
1.	About: a brief biographical statement
2.	Contact: a way to encourage correspondence 
3.	Projects: publications, multimedia/audiovisual works, media appearances, etc. 
4.	Optional pages for your education, research interests, extracurricular activities, etc.

This hybrid course spans 4 weeks with four 1-hour synchronous lectures over Zoom on Friday mornings. Between the weekly lectures, participants MUST consult recommended videos available through the Udemy workshop, ?Wordpress for Beginners - Master Wordpress Quickly? taught by Andrew Williams. These videos will cover essential information that will not be covered in the lectures but is key to building your ePortfolio. A Moodle site will also exist.

Udemy course link: https://concordia.udemy.com/course/wordpress-for-beginners-course/

In this workshop you will learn to:
- Acquire a domain, design a site map, and build a basic Wordpress website
- Explore themes and tools to customize a website using best practices
